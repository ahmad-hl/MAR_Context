# MAR_Context

To define a virtual space, an MAR system requires to define the physical context to speed up localization.
## To define the context, we need to record the device sensor data including:
1. IMU data, GPS
2. Light sensor data (from the front of the phone).
3. AR-based Focal length and Aperture.
